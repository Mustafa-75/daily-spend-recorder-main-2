 # 🧾 Expense Report Tracker (Python CLI)

A simple, terminal-based expense tracking tool built with Python. This project replicates core functionalities of modern full-stack expense apps — like adding, viewing, and deleting expenses — all in a single `.py` file, using file handling for data persistence.
